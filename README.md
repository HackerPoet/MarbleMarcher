# Marble Marcher Community Edition

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jgoldfar/MarbleMarcher.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jgoldfar/MarbleMarcher)

## Original Summary
* *Marble Marcher is a video game demo that uses a fractal physics engine and fully procedural rendering to produce beautiful and unique gameplay unlike anything you've seen before.

* *The goal of the game is to reach the flag as quickly as possible.  But be careful not to
* *fall off the level or get crushed by the fractal!  There are 24 levels to unlock.

## System Dependencies
* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)
* [SFML 2.5.0](https://www.sfml-dev.org)
### MacOS
On macOS these can be conveniently installed using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

`brew install eigen sfml`

(Note that SFML might require a newer version than the one from Homebrew, in which case a manual installation is required)

Alternatively, [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) can be used:

`vcpkg install eigen3 sfml`
### Arch Linux
`sudo pacman -S eigen sfml git cmake make`



## Building
### MacOS
* `mkdir build && cd build`
* `cmake ..`
    * If you use `vcpkg`, add the flag `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[path/to/vcpkg]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake`
* `cd ..`
* `cmake --build build`

Alternatively, one can use the platform-dependent build system, for example `Make`:

* `make -C build`
### Arch Linux
* `cd ~`
* `git clone https://github.com/HackerPoet/MarbleMarcher.git`
* `cd MarbleMarcher`
* `mkdir build && cd build`
* `cmake ..`
* `cd ..`
* `cmake --build build`
* `cp build/MarbleMarcher ./`


## Launching
* Make sure that the current working directory contains the `assets` folder
* Run the executable generated by CMake, located in `build` (or a subdirectory)
* If running MarbleMarcher from a tarball and you see a message like

> ./MarbleMarcher: error while loading shared libraries: libsfml-graphics.so.2.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

You'll just need to run MarbleMarcher with the correct `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`:

```shell
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`/usr/lib ./MarbleMarcher
```
